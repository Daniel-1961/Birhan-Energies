# Brent Oil Price Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Brent crude oil prices** from **May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022** to identify major price shifts and understand how **economic, political, and market events** impact oil prices. The analysis uses **time series models** such as **ARIMA, Markov-Switching ARIMA, and LSTM** to forecast price trends and detect regime shifts.


## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Identify major price shift points using **change detection**.
✔ Model price fluctuations using **ARIMA and Markov-Switching ARIMA**.
✔ Implement **LSTM neural networks** for oil price forecasting.
✔ Analyze the impact of **economic and geopolitical events**.
✔ Visualize trends and insights for better decision-making.

## 📊 Methodology
### 1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Check for missing values, trends, seasonality.
- Identify **change points** in price movements.

### 2️⃣ **Time Series Modeling**
- **ARIMA** for short-term forecasting.
- **Markov-Switching ARIMA** to capture different market regimes.
- **LSTM Neural Network** for long-term dependencies.

### 3️⃣ **Forecasting & Evaluation**
- Compare model performance using **MSE, RMSE, and MAE**.
- Visualize predictions and identify **significant event impacts**.
